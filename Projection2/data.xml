Indeed, Los Angeles remains the most photographed and least remembered city in the world, and will most likely stay that way.</English>

      <English>Up to my right on the Mulholland ridge above Tarzana, there's a scenic overview where you can park your car and sit on a bench and look out across the whole San Fernando Valley. Seven miles wide, at its widest, and twenty miles long, the valley's like an island surrounded not by water, but by mountains, and I like to sit up on the Mulholland ridge and imagine what it looked like five hundred years before the Spanish came. I put my thumb up the way actors playing painters do, to crop the foreground, blot out the bank buildings at Sepulveda, the rides at Universal, the black glass Blue Cross/Blue Shield headquarters in Canoga Park, and I try to imagine what this place looked like before the horse. Before the train. Before the car. That's the game The West invites, the game everybody plays out West: pretending we can see the past, here, in the present.</English>

      <English>I used to like this town. A long time ago. There were trees along Wilshire Boulevard. Beverly Hills was a country town. Westwood was bare hills and lots offering at eleven hundred dollars and no takers. Hollywood was a bunch of frame houses on the interurban line. Los Angeles was just a big dry sunny place with ugly homes and no style, but goodhearted and peaceful. It had the climate they just yap about now. People used to sleep out on porches. Little groups who thought they were intellectual used to call it the Athens of America. It wasn't that, but it wasn't a neon-lighted slum either.</English>

      <English>From Mount Hollywood, Los Angeles looks rather nice, enveloped in a haze of changing colors. Actually, and in spite of all the healthful sunshine and ocean breezes, it is a bad place —full of old, dying people, and young people who wereold of tired pioneer parents, victims of America — full of curious, wild and poisonous growths, decadent religions and cults and fake science, and wildcat business enterprises, which, with their aim for quick profits, are doomed to collapse and drag down multitudes of people...A jungle...</English>

      <English>The next morning, I happened to be jogging on the beach in Santa Monica, heading north, in the direction of Malibu, as the sun was rising behind me. The sky was already bright, though the sun was still occluded behind a low-clinging fog bank over LAX. The Malibu mountains up ahead were dark and clear and distinct, and seemed as if freshly minted. Presently, the sun must have broken out from behind the fog bank - I realized this because suddenly the sand around me turned pale purplish pink and my own long shadow shot out before me. I looked up at the mountains, and the were gone: lost in the airlight.</English>

It's true there are a zillion places no one in his right mind would live: Lakewood, Torrance, Brea, Compton, Carson, no one real lived there, any more than real people lived in those grey asphalt boxes that line the roads between New York's airport and its island. "Real" L.A. had its thick, coiled root downtown, and on the east, little underground rootlets; obscure Mexican restaurants. Then a thin stem, the Santa Monica freeway, heading due west and putting out greenery, places in this western desert where you'd love to live - if things went right.</English>

From Malibu to Balboa almost continuous white sand beach runs for seventy-odd miles, nearly all of it open to public access, much less of it encroached upon by industry than alarmist literature might lead one to suppose....Los Angeles is the greatest City-on-the-Shore in the world; its only notable rival, in fact, is Rio de Janeiro (though the open ocean-beaches of Los Angeles are preferable in many ways) and its only rival in potential is, probably, Perth, Western Australia.</English>

No recent architect has so ingeniously elaborated the urban security function or so brazenly embraced the resulting frisson as Los Angeles's Pritzker Prize laureate, Frank Gehry....With sometimes chilling luminosity, his work clarifies the underlying relations of repression, surveillance and exclusion that characterize the fragmented, paranoid spatiality towards which Los Angeles seems to aspire.</English>

      <English>In the long run, Frank Sinatra got ripped off. Decades ago, when the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce put his star down on the sidewalk, they put it on Vine Street rather than on Hollywood Boulevard. The thinking probably was that the Sinatra star would be a draw, people would come down from the boulevard to see it, to take a picture. But if that was the plan, it didn't work. Frank was alone in a spot that probably saw more hypes than tourists. His star was at a crosswalk between two parking lots and next to a residence hotel where you had to convince the security guard to unlock the lobby door if you wanted to go in.</English>

      <English>If you visit Los Angeles, or even if you live here, the La Brea Tar Pits, the real dark heart of Los Angeles, seem like a mere tourist attraction, an entertaining stop along the way. Yet the whole history of the city lies buried here, from the late Pleistocene era on. The tar pits are noir, figuratively and literally. They are a wide, gaping, black graveyard, in some places hidden and paved over, in others visible, and sticky. The tar pits contain L.A.'s earliest resource, pitch (as in 'pitch black'), which is really solidified petroleum, also called asphaltum, a thick layer of goo between the surface and L.A.'s later, deeper resource, oil.

      <English>When I moved to L.A. in the late 1970, my first impression of the place was that it was one big garden, flowered and perfumed, full of luscious blooms - trees studded with huge creamy magnolia blossoms and pink and yellow frangipani, jacaranda trees with their clouds of exquisite flowers lining entire streets and creating extraordinary canopies of lavender. Everywhere there were bushes loaded with yellow and red hibiscus, and camellias and gardenias, and the almost sickening odor of night-blooming jasmine hung on the air - everywhere this almost funereal smell and garish beauty. It all seemed so untamed to me, as if these plants didn't actually belong to anyone but were part of some natural and rampant floral disorder, a special endowment, like a native birthright instead of being transplants from the Old World and the South Seas. Having move to L.A. from the rather monochromatic world of the Great Basin, I couldn't quite fathom such a lurid landscape or understand why anyone would actually go out and buy fl</English>

      <English>'The Devil's Deputy was to have its 'world premiere' at Gloobry's Milllion Dollar Melanesian Theatre; and these 'world premieres' are, as you know, the great social events of Southern California. Searchlights search the clouds and bombs boom in the sky; red fire makes an imitation Hades in the streets, and klieg lights make day in the arcade which the million dollar Melanesians hold upright on their naked shoulders. The crowds pack the streets, and swarms of burglars invade the city, because all the police department is required to make a pathway for the movie stars as they move in their appointed courses, from their shining ten thousand dollar limousines, across the sidewalk and through the arcade and under the million dollar portals. The kliegs glare upon them, and a dozen moving picture cameras grind, and flashlights boom, and the crowd surges and quivers and murmurs with ecstasy.

      <English>On Hoyt Street the houses were neither fancy nor ugly, but like the house of poor folks everywhere. While some were constructed of stucco, the majority were of wood, Madera. Wood was plentiful and cheaper than cement, so wood it was. The house, while not uniform, had some similarities; a window on each side and a door smack in the middle. Others appeared lopsided because of the many additions tacked on as a family grew.

      <English>The red light caught me at Manchester; and that made me warm. It never failed; every time I got in a hurry I got caught by every light. I pulled up in the outside lane, abreast a V-8 and an olds, shifted back to first, and got set to take the lead. When the light turned green it caught a white coupe in the middle of the street. The V-8 full of white guys dug off and they started to run for it; and the two white guys in the Olds blasted at them with the horn, making them jump like grasshoppers. But when they looked up and saw we were colored they just took their time, giving us a look of cold hatred.
	I let out the clutch and stepped on the gas. Goddamn 'em, I'll grind 'em into the street, I thought. But just before I hit them something held me. I tamped the brake.

      <English>Those who live and work in South Central know that the area's problems have deep historical roots. The beginning of this century saw an influx of blacks emigrating from the oppressive conditions of the Jim Crow South. The golden and expansive West, with its mild, cloudless days, eucalyptus trees and bending palms, symbolized the utopian concepts of unconditional freedom and absolute equality. Housing and entrepreneurial opportunities appeared plentiful and endless. For a while the city seemed to live up to their dreams. The number of black families settling in the Southland increased throughout the thirties and forties. Black doctors, lawyers and businessmen continued to prosper. Their offices lined Central Avenue, black L.A.'s major thoroughfare. Know as 'Harlem West' - a literary arts and music center blooming with jazz clubs and soft-lit salons.
	Around the time of the Watts rebellion in 1965, middle-class black families began to abandon the area for safer hilltops and outlying suburbs in an exodus that co</English>

      <English>He had patrolled these streets with dozens of other partners, with partners now dead even, like Whitey Duncan. This street was a vivid part of his learning. He had been educated in southeast Los Angeles and Central Avenue had been a valuable schoolroom, but this hissing inferno was not Central Avenue. Then Roy for the first time noticed the two cars overturned and burning. He suddenly could not remember what kind of buildings had been there on Forty-seventh and Forty-sixth that were now sheets of flame two hundred feet high.</English>

      <English>Imagine the site of Los Angeles County four thousand years ago. The people who lived there - the Tongva, the Chumash, the Tataviam - turned birds and deer into food and clothes, and turned trees, water, rocks, and dirt into shelter, energy, tools, boats, medicine, religious objects, art....They told stories about nature to explain the world and to guide their actions within it.
	What do we do in Los Angeles now? Essentially the same thing.</English>

      <English>He grew up hooked on girls and sports and nursed a vague sense of adventure. His father was a foreman at the Proto-Tool plant. It was lots of work for marginal pay and zero adventure. He tried Proto-Tool himself. It was boring and hard on the body. He tried junior college and pondered a teaching career. The notion didn't really send him.
	His sisters married cops. He had one brother-in-law on the South Gate PD and one on the Highway patrol. They told him enticing stories. The yarns dovetailed with some other notions he'd been kicking around.
	He wanted adventure. He wanted to help people. He took the entrance test for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department the day after his twenty-first birthday.

It was originally planned to build the New York set at the Fox ranch in Malibu, but after months of surveys on costs and the arc of the sun ..., the Malibu site was abandoned. In the first place, there was no way that the set could be constructed without the Santa Monica Mountains forming a backdrop for the New York skyline. Secondly, the cost of trucking building materials out to Malibu, on top of the already staggering construction estimates, would have made the set budget prohibitive. And lastly, there were the unions.</English>

      <English>We have been hated for half a century now by everyone east of Tonapah and north of navel Fluff, Oklahoma. Hate for our weather. Hated for our freedom. Hated for our success. Hated for our love of life. hated for our enthusiasms. We have all felt those pangs, on journeys, when fellow vacationists enthuse more than we about sunrises, high noons, full moons, fine women. Enthusiasm-envy is an old story in this tired world. So the world right now would love to see us Fall. If God drove us out of the California Garden tomorrow, the mob would line up a billion deep to applaud His good sense and stone the smiles on our faces. But we will not fall or be driven or be stoned.

      <English>Three guys were arguing in an East Los Angeles bar and one said angrily: 'The trouble with you is that you're just a Mexican with a gray-flannel serape.'
	'That's better than being a cholo who professes love for "la raza" and Mexico and yet came here to live, work and have your children,' was the heated retort.
	The third man argued against all such 'self-defeating' terms as Mexican -American, cholo (slang for a Mexican immigrant), pocho (slang for an American-born Mexican), Spanish-American and Latin American.
	Being from Texas he especially resented the last term because in parts of Texas a saying goes that 'a Latin American is a Mexican who has paid his poll tax.'
	'No, you're both wrong,' he said. 'We're American....We're Spanish-speaking Americans.'

Past shining shops and apartments and enormous hotels. On every building the vertical lines of light went up like rockets into the dark sky. And the building themselves - they too had almost rocketed into existence. Thirty years ago Los Angeles was a one-horse - a half-horse - town. In 1940 or thereabouts it is scheduled to be as big as Paris. As big and as gay. The great Joy City of the West.</English>

From our house in Pasadena I had watched the wide face of the mountains burn. Later I fought fire in the San Bernardinos near Forest Home. In La Crescenta during the autumn on 1933, we save Poet MacIntryre's cabin from the flames, only to lose it to flood on New Year's Day. For six years we lived in Beverly Glen, a canyon in the easternmost Santa Monicas, and there taught the boys the peril of open fires and wind, and were relieved when we quite the canyon for the open plain.

      <English>On the corner of La Huerta Road was a minature Rhine castle with tarpaper turrets pierced for archers. Next to it was a highly colored shack with domes and minarets out of the Arabian Nights. Again, he was charitable. Both houses were comic, but he didn't laugh. Their desire to startle was so eager and guileless.

      <English>The California sunshine continued to pour down. The streets, the stucco mansions, the lawns and shrubbery sparkled with light. These friends of mine went on visiting one another's homes and giving outdoor dinner parties, the ladies in their lovely frocks scattered over the terrace at the tables, chattering and affectionate, while their husbands stood off by themselves in small clusters, nodding and smiling and smoking; my friends kept on their housekeepers and gardeners and children's nurses; they still sent their children to dancing school, to supervised play groups. 'And every month,' as a man named Curtis Spogel once remarked sadly to me, 'another few Defense Bonds cashed in at the bank and dissipated.'

My computer is right there on my desk, and my work, mail, faxes, contact, come to me, Light and sky, a vertical swatch of the Hollywood Hills, all come to me through the faux bay window in the living room. I can plant myself safely in the window seat I rigged up and look out, see pavement, Laurel Avenue, cars, the streetcleaner on Tuesday mornings, a sleeping ceramic child and the ugly, treacherous, stolen cactus in our small plot of a front yard.</English>

      <English>It's an animal instinct to want to touch or smell the dead. Elephants tenderly caress with their trunks the carcasses of their kin. Chimps poke at their lifeless companions. Wolves keen. You want to know, with your own senses, that someone is no longer breathing. I kept imagining my father's breath, but he was absolutely still, utterly foreign. I wished I could wrap my arms around him, lay my head on his chest.

Then I went out and turned northward on Los Angeles Street, and suddenly familiar signs on barber shops and restaurants came to view. I felt as though I had discovered a new world.

      <English>Every day, we would get in my friend's convertible and drive somewhere — to a restaurant, to a bookstore, to the movies, to the beach. I would sit in the passenger seat and stare out at the endless parade of streets and buildings, the bungalows and palm trees, postage stamp lawns and stucco storefronts, all of it as indistinct as a film set, as if there were no underlying narrative here at all. I remember I kept asking where downtown was, as if this might somehow root me; little did I realize that for most Angelenos, downtown glitters in the distance like the Emerald City, the city center as illusion, as the place we never reach.

      <English>Under the Sixth Street Bridge, in a place where many homeless people used to camp, a tent city rose again, this time with new tents that had been professionally distressed and aged. Scenic painters covered the buildings in religious murals; a union graffiti artist tagged them over. Sarah Greenwood, the production designer, who came out with Wright from England, said, "Our San Julian Street was a hybrid of all streets, a microcosm of all the downtown streets. Our version is much denser and more colorful. We wanted to get some Mexican in there. San Julian Street itself is actually very boring."

      <English>So you have to remove the soul and the intellect because you cannot possibly get to the bottom of that so they become these bodies and the bodies become completely interesting. Seeing them in the way that a kid does a toy, if someone overpowers you the only way to understand them is to take them apart and understand every detail and aspect of them. So bodily fluid becomes part of that information about them that you're studying, whereby trying to understand why this person does that to you.'</English>

It is the story of where those murders begin, of how they take form and enter our actions, how they transform our lives, how their legacies spill into the world and the history around us. And it is a story of how the claims of violence and murder end - if, indeed, they ever end.</English>

      <English>For months after the shooting incident, I had headaches and malaise. I was on every type of med but still couldn't make it through the night without sweating through at least one pair of pajamas. I'd get up and read in the living room—one light burning, a desert wind rattling the empty garbage cans, a storm of tiny flowers driven off the pittosporum trees—and like the homeowner who has iced an intruder, or a soldier who destroys a tank, I gained the special knowledge only righteous shooters share: Even the most selfless action, even the defense of your country, doesn't mean a happy ending. They save the worst for the so-called hero.

      <English>Have you ever tasted Indonesian urap? Because if you haven't, it may be difficult for me to describe the version, which ranks among the most exotic salads in the world, made at Indo Café. The ingredients are straightforward enough: cabbage, blanched bean sprouts and parboiled long beans. The salad is tossed with coconut, then shredded into a rough, pink paste, whose overtones include sweetness and penetrating bitterness, fleeting perfume and a sort of persistent, almost human reek that is akin to the smell of a beaded angora sweater pulled from the bottom of a pile at a vintage shop. If you were going to wear the sweater, you would probably take it to the dry cleaner first, or at least put it in the sink with some Woolite, but we are talking about a salad. The antique scent of the seasoned coconut, which could be fresh galangal, or fermented shrimp paste, or kaffir lime, nestles into the flavor of the long beans like a fitted garment, and the urap is inconceivable without it.</English>

      <English>Those were hard days in Los Angeles. It was known formally as El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles de Porciuncula, and as the name suggests, its emotional and cultural ties were with Mexico. As an American city after 1850, however, Los Angeles grew under the grim guidance of an oligarchy determined to build a great city and to profit by its growth, their city was struck in their image, one startlingly in contrast to San Francisco's. the City, as San Francisco would forever be know to Californians, was liberal, Catholic, and organized around the sea and its workforce. Los Angeles was Protestant, conservative, oriented toward its dry valleys, and staggeringly effective at keeping labor in its place.</English>

She liked wearing the right clothes at the right times. She hated to think she might be inappropriate. She would sometimes see a woman in exercise leggings, usually a small child or tow with here, and notice the way the bottom curve of her rear end wiggled, the flesh on the side of her thighs, the saddlebags, accentuated. The woman would always be wearing a big T-shirt, usually with some company name or sports product logo, "Just Do It," long and loose, but not enough to cover the round bump of postchildbirth stomach.</English>

      <English>I believe we are living in the time of the Islamic reformation. In fact, I think we are living in the twilight of that reformation. For me, the word reform is defined by its inevitability. This process cannot be stopped; it can be slowed down for a time but reform is inevitable. It's an historic reformation taking place within Islam — it's adapting itself to the realities of the world around it. I think we'll see the same process we saw in the Christian reformation from doctrinal absolutism to doctrinal relativism; toward a truly indigenous Islamic enlightenment. And it's up to us as Muslims in the US to give voice to that for our brothers and sisters who don't have the voice or the same ability to speak out as we do.</English>

      <English>We drink another two hundred dollars' worth of wine and then order dessert. Claire gets the chef's specialty, tiramisu. I order the crème brulee. After dessert, but before we order our complimentary coffee, Claire goes to the bathroom to call a cab. The restaurant is packed. There are a hundred people eating dinner, another forty in the bar, and maybe another twenty-five waiting outside because they don't know anyone.
	Our waiter drops off the check. He looks disappointed that Claire is away from the table.
	"Great service," I say.
	"It was my pleasure."
	I pick up the check. $727.95.
	The balance of my checking account is $521.13. I haven't paid my Visa bill in two months.
	Twenty minutes later, the bill stuffed into Claire's purse, we walk out of the restaurant. Clair sticks her head into the kitchen and thanks the chef on the way of. "Brilliant again," she says.</English>

      <English>the Star was not, strictly speaking, a cinema. This would have been obvious to anyone who visited the dilapidated building that stood across from a butcher and a tailor on one of the garbage-strewn alleys of Hay An Najat. Nevertheless, that was the name that a Casablanca charitable association had given to the place where, every week, a new older movie was projected on a cracked screen, and where patrons competed with rats fro space on the gutted seats. For five dirhams, Yousset could watch Hong Kong action films, Bollywood romances, Egyptian dramas, or American blockbusters. He never missed a show.</English>

      <English>It occurs to me that a child is something that gets stolen bit by bit. A two-year-old dissolves into a five-year-old, and no picture can adequately bring back the feel of him, the sound of his voice, and all the intangible qualities that made him himself at that moment. A ten-year-old becomes fifteen, then seventeen. Then he slips out of your life altogether and the baby who once required your endless gaze now covers his eyes.</English>

Lots of new mansions up there, but Will's house wasn't one of them. Supervisors make a decent salary, plus some perks. Orange County is one of the most expensive places in the country Will's place was a tear-down by the new standards of the neighborhood.</English>

      <English>Across America in the 1930, it was not unheard of for people to talk about the possible violent overthrow of the government, just as had happened in Russia. But even more common was the idea that change would come not by toppling the president or Congress or the military, but by toppling the established social order. For the big farmers of central California - old cowboys and Southern cotton men who fancied themselves rugged individualists - August 1930 was a time when such a prospect seemed terrifyingly real.</English>

And this seems to have nothing much to do with actual achievement, with how well or badly they're doing. Hollywood success and Hollywood failure can be equally corrupting, though presumably in different ways.</English>

      <English>In fact, when basketball or reading novels or traveling becomes work, it can involve a precipitous loss of pleasure. We all can understand that work might have its own pleasures, but that is a different matter. Take the case of Hollywood, where people work all the time, constantly, even though many don't seem to actually work more than a couple of months a year. The forced resignation of the president of the Writers Guild of America a couple years ago, after it was found that she had not produced enough work to be an active member of the guild (which requires one ninety-minute script every three years), is one piece of evidence for how intermittent Hollywood work can be.</English>

      <English>The more complex the story, the better. Two sides to a conflict or two levels to a tale were not enough - I wanted three or four or five. Only then did I sense I was getting it right. Most situations have nuances, after all, and most people are a shaded mix of qualities, and most issues yield several understandable points of view. Stories that did not reflect such layers left me suspicious. When a prosecutor insists that the accused murder is "evil incarnate," my eyes glaze over. On the other hand, when a neighbor allows that she sort of likes the defendant even if she's guilty, and thinks there's good in the bad people she knows and bad in the good, I sit up straight.</English>

But whenever these sightseeing excursions took her away from the sections where Negroes lived, she immediately lost all interest in what she was being shown. The Pacific Ocean in itself did not cause her heartbeat to quicken, nor did the roaring of the waves find an emotional echo within her. But on coming upon Bruce's Beach for colored people near Redondo, or the little strip of sandied shore they had appropriated for themselves at Santa Monica, the Pacific Ocean became an intriguing something to contemplate as a background for their activities. Everything was interesting as it was patronized, reflected through, or acquired by Negores.</English>

It has never imparted an urban character to its incoming population for the simple reason that it has never had any character to impart. On the other hand, the place has the manners, culture and general outlook of a huge country village.</English>

      <English>I am picturing the time I was in my living room with my sprained foot propped up, talking to my friend Lucia. But as I think if her she changes, her African skin becomes a leopard, her black almond eyes turn orange and watch me. I am lamenting a string of bad luck that has seemed to come my way these past months: the tumble down the stairs, a fall from Harley in which I sprained my back, cracked my tailbone. She is not sympathetic.
	"God touches us with a feather to get our attention," she growls. "Then if he don't listen, he starts throwing bricks."</English>

      <English>The trouble begins with the sun, the spotlight which floods the city, throwing everything into relief. The sun and all it suggests, the infinite pleasures and permanent tans, is how the world knows Los Angeles, one of the few instantly recognizable modern metropolises without a defining architectural totem - save for the Hollywood sign, of course. The world knows Los Angeles through the movies and television, and if you live here long enough, you realize it's not much different for some Angelenos. It is the city's defining paradox that even as it has become one of a handful of global cities in the last half-century, it remains principally identified with its fantasy industries. In his film The Lady from Shanghai, the sailor played by Orson Welles gets off a boat in Acapulco, squints at the sun and declares, 'It's a bright, guilty world.' It's easy to imagine that Welles was thinking og Los Angeles when he said that line, for it neatly captures the popular view of the city as transparent and opaque at once, a dreamscape of seduction and shame. Welle's path to and from L.A. is familiar, but it's worth noting that he never could stay away from long. Whether out of habit or necessity, this city of bright and fallen angels keeps a tight hold on those who loathe it; perhaps especially to those who do.</English>

      <English>I'll admit it: I'm spiritually challenged. It's not that I don't appreciate the natural wonders of the world -- it's not that I don't experience awe! It's only that I look to people, not religion, to make sense of it. Wallace Stegner on the American West gets to me, more than the West alone ever could. My dog regularly breaks my heart, but I need to read William Maxwell to understand why. I've seen a whale breach, and it brought me to tears. But life-changing in the way of Melville's "Moby-Dick"? No. It's human expression, the urge to mark the moment, to find the meaning or make it up if that's what it takes -- via words, sentences, paragraphs, books! -- that finally buckles these poor, old knees.</English>

      <English>Moving to Los Angeles is a bit like becoming a Republican. It is also, especially for New Yorkers, the ultimate bourgeois act. There is an element to living here that involves a certain hanging up of bohemian credentials, a surrender to the strip malls and car culture and suburb-oriented infrastructure that rankles those of us who purport to be "against" such things. As unimaginative a political position as this is, it can't be denied that LA, for all its corners of funky, urban grit (see: the tatooed hipsters of Silverlake and Echo Park), will probably never shake its reputation for bottle-blond wannabe starlets and drug-addled, mansion-dwelling lotharios (see: the Phil Spector homicide scandal). Despite a formidable, albeit subtle, intellectual 
	community in Los Angeles, the city's brand recognition remains tied around a celebrated
	American stereotype: the general flakiness of Californians and the more particular (and insidious) shallowness of Angelenos.</English>

      <English>I ran away for the first time when I was five. One rainy Sunday morning while the household slept late, I put on a raincoat and rubbers and went out the back door. Two blocks away I hid in the crawl space of an old frame house that sat high off the ground and was surrounded by trees. It was dry and out of the rain, and I could peer out at the world. The family dog quickly found me but preferred being hugged and petted to sending out an alarm. I stayed there until darkness came, the rain stopped, and a cold wind came up. Even in Los Angeles, a December night can be cold for a fie-year-old.</English>

      <English>In my experience as a bookseller, the novel has never wavered in its appeal and its ability to excite. When I first came to Lou Virgil's Brentwood Book Shop, soon rechristened Dutton's Brentwood Books, I found a business situated in a perfectly Edenic spot for a bookstore with a clientele that was sophisticated, educated and curious. At that moment, Louise Erdrich's Love Medicine seemed to be the rage among serious readers, having garnered positive reviews and a sizable number of literary prizes. Hers was a new voice — how lovely that writers on the silent page possess voices — and the subject matter seemed to matter. I also had a particular staff member who pressed that book into as many hands as he could, to generally grateful responses. But the world of fiction is a high-risk market, and none more so than the specialty of "literary fiction."</English>

      <English>As I'm sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think.  It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience.  Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed.</English>

      <English>"Have you ever tried Okinawan sake?"
	It wasn't a question. Not the way the giant Korean dude said it. Not the way he and his band of long-haired, tattooed, well-armed friends stood around grinning like something fun was about to happen, like the haole might just burst into flames after he drank. This wasn't something I could politely decline. I couldn't feign an allergy or pat my stomach and say I was full. I was going to try Okinawan sake.
	I put on my game face, lifted the glass of clear liquid and took a sip. It had a distinct bouquet, pungent and acrid like a science experiment, but it didn't taste bad. It wasn't nearly as rough as the Sonoran tequila I'd had in Hermosillo or the homemade corn whiskey some hillbilly foisted on me in the Ozarks. I smiled at my hosts, the elite undercover narcotic squad of the Honolulu Police Department, and nodded politely. Then, I waited for the punch line.
	That came quickly enough, when the bartender, his grin the brightest thing in the room, pulled a large glass jar from behind the bar and revealed the secret ingredient in Okinawan sake. It was a dead snake, about 3 feet long, coiled and marinating at the bottom of a gallon of rice wine; a venomous pit viper called Habu, to be exact, its poison alchemically becoming a kind of "natural Viagra" after a few weeks of soaking in the booze.
	As a large Samoan detective began singing in a shimmering, majestic falsetto -- the classic Hawaiian song "Hi'ilawe" -- I ordered a second shot just to see the look on the bartender's face.</English>

      <English>My introduction to black - excuse me, Black - literature happened during the summer between eighth and ninth grades when the Los Angeles Unified School District, out of the graciousness of its repressive little heart, sent me a copy of Maya Angelou's "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings." It was the first book I'd ever opened written by an African-American author. Notice I said "opened" and not "read." I made it through a few pages before I began to get suspicious. Why would a school district that didn't bother to supply me with a working pair of left-handed scissors, a decipherable pre-algebra text or a slice of pepperoni pizza with more than two pepperonis on it send me a new book? Why care about my welfare now?</English>

And he thought of Markham and his mother and all these uncountable people, never loosening their grip on their hopes, and their strange human sense, their last illusion, that no matter how the days moved through them, there always remained the pulse of things coming, the sense that even now there was yet still time.</English>

And the less work she gave them, the less she had to do. She noticed that another middle school English teacher had stumbled upon a brilliant solution: debate. It had the air of intellectual rigor, but you never had to bring piles of it home with you to correct.</English>

      <English>More than magic, I kept being drawn to questions of faith - what it means to believe. I think many of the masters of American literature - Hawthorne, O'Connor, Morrison - have dealt heavily with issues of religion and faith. The way we believe, why we believe, or how we express what we believe is constantly changing, and this is something that the hybrid culture of the botanica lends itself to examining.</English>

      <English>Write from the gut and soul. Spill it. Write from las alturas and from hoyos (avoid cheap, italicized, affected use of Spanish words). Don't offer excuses, explanations, apologies, apologias (the Latin). Remember Danny Santiago? His theme, his gimmick and hook, was being Chicano. Explaining, i.e., apologia lit. In other words, don't write for Them. Don't respond to their issues (if they ask about the gang problems in your community, ask them what they're doing about their biker and pedophile problems). Try to please God or the Virgin and not others (well, Others). But privately. As in silent prayer. They know you are flesh, know your tears of joy and pain. You will quit your day job; if you're a writer, you'll be fired often enough, anyway. If you want to be The Leader of the People, if you want to be a Saint, if you want to be The Guru, please don't pretend to be first of all a writer. Unless you're dead.</English>

      <English>Yet Los Angeles has a center, if only because simple geometry tells us it must. For every area, there exists a point from which you can't get any farther away from one border without getting closer to another. In Los Angeles - the city rather than the surrounding county - this centerpoint exists in the Santa Monica Mountains beneath a tree just north of Upper Franklin Canyon Reservoir, roughly a mile's drive from the intersection of Coldwater Canyon Boulevard and Mulholland Drive.</English>
