This is all code that is dependent on ElVisBlobTracker that was originally developed
for use in LAFACE, but was ultimately discarded for a live video option. It will NOT
run in its current condition, as much of the code is still attempting to refer to
LAFACEMain, and the organization of the classes is far from optimal.

Everything in the shows package implements the Animation interface, as they are
designed for visual output using ElectrolandLightingUtils.

A Target follows a Track returned by ElVisBlobTracker. A Candidate follows a Track to
evaluate its vector and ensure consistent movement. A Mover follows a Candidate and
will continue along a Candidates vector even if the Track is sporadic or drops off
the system entirely. Movers are ultimately what are referenced by the shows in order
to get the equivalent of a low-pass-filtered position data.
