Pay close attention to deletion of arrays.  VS seems to have trouble with them;  Look at PersonStats::~PersonStats() 




got through all couts,cerrs, and clogs.  Decide which shoudl go where (and which should be removed).  Remove endls so things can be buffered


redirect cout to something else
