1.) erase() method just paints the Clip the same color as the stage.  It 
    should actually erase the Image (so that alpha on the edge doesn't overlap)
2.) some kind of command line way to set stuff in motion would be nice.
3.) clip rect is not implemented
4.) sync is not tested to elu
5.) implement some non image based Clips
6.) implement "changes"
7.) curved paths
