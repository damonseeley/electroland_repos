AudioMeter

The AudioMeter is platform specific.
(XP) Install SuperColliderSoundControl/SuperColliderSynthDefs/AudioMeter/AudioMeter_SwingOSC.sc in c:\SuperCollider\Extensions
(OS X) Install SuperColliderSoundControl/SuperColliderSynthDefs/AudioMeter/AudioMeter.sc in (~)/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/

To launch the audiometer on either platform, open SuperColliderSoundControl/SuperColliderSynthDefs/AudioMeter/LaunchAudioMeter.scd and evaluate the single line of code in there.
