Untested conditions that will fail on startup:

1.) poorly formatted Controller or Light properties in the properties file
2.) ListnerPort not specified in the properties file
3.) Light properties referencing non-existent LightController objects
4.) holes in sequence of lighting channels per Light

Instead of validating 4, we should get rid of channels in the properties file,
and update LightController to use a sequence.
